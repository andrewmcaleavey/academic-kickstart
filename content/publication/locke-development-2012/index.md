abstract: "A short version of the Counseling Center Assessment of Psychological Symptoms–62 (CCAPS-62) was created via three studies. The final short version (CCAPS-34), which contains 34 items and 7 subscales, demonstrated good discrimination power, support for the proposed factor structure, strong initial convergent validity, and adequate test–retest stability over 1-week and 2-week intervals."
